# Edge Cutter: A Streamlined Video Editing Solution for Gamers and Content Creators

Edge Cutter is a video editing application developed as a final project for Harvard's CS50 course. The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly and efficient video editing experience tailored to the needs of gamers, streamers, and content creators. The program allows users to import videos, select facecam and gameplay regions, and export a portrait-sized video with the facecam footage occupying the top third and the gameplay footage filling the remaining two-thirds.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and folders:

- `editor.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the entire codebase for the Edge Cutter application. It includes the implementation of the `VideoEditorGUI` class, which is responsible for the user interface, and the `ResizableRectangle` class, which allows users to select and resize regions within the imported video.

- `data`: This folder contains two subfolders:
  - `input`: Stores input videos to be processed by the application.
  - `output`: Stores the output videos generated by the application after processing.

## Design Choices

During the development of Edge Cutter, several design choices were considered and implemented to enhance the user experience and ensure the application's functionality:

1. **Resizable rectangles**: To provide an intuitive way for users to select facecam and gameplay regions, the application includes draggable and resizable rectangles. This feature underwent various iterations to ensure smooth resizing and to prevent rectangles from going out of the canvas bounds.

2. **Output video dimensions**: The output video dimensions were adjusted to ensure that facecam and gameplay widths are equal to the output width, providing a seamless viewing experience without any black bars.

3. **User interface refinements**: Several UI refinements were made to enhance the user experience, such as starting with a single "Import Video" button at the center of the frame, and dynamically adding the "Open Output Folder" button upon successful processing of a video.

4. **Error handling**: To handle cases where users might import non-video files, the application was updated to display an error message prompting users to import video files only, such as MP4 or MKV formats.

Edge Cutter demonstrates a practical application of programming skills acquired during the CS50 course while providing a valuable tool for the digital media landscape. The project is a testament to the power of programming and the creative solutions it can bring to a wide range of industries and applications.
